%************************The declaration of authors of Modified Stolt's fk migration***************************
% MFKMIG: 
% 1) Modified Stolt's fk migration is designed 
%    by J. Huo et al.  
% 2) The file of "main.mat" is main function, and other files
%    can be called by "main.mat"                                                                           
% 3) This modification is based on the conventional Stolt's 
%    fk migration algorithm                                       
% 4) The original code of the fk migration code is from the 
%    public domain at website: en.verysource.com, 
%    which can be used for the non-profit purpose. 


%    The declaration from the original authors of the 
%    conventional Stolt's fk code is attached below
